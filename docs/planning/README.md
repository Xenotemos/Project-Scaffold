# Planning Index

- alignment.md captures the evergreen alignment note that should be reviewed before shaping new work.
- roadmap.md summarises the current plan for v0.17.3 and rolls up the open initiatives.
- archive/roadmaps/ stores historical roadmap documents. They remain read-only references once work is merged.
- archive/updates/ contains the per-version update notes that fed previous roadmap iterations.

Add new planning material in this directory so future cleanups only need to touch a single tree.
