You are generating synthetic conversation snippets to AUGMENT the CAHM subtle-boundary dataset.

Goal
- Produce nuanced boundary/consent/pressure cases WITHOUT explicit assault/harassment keywords.
- Capture indirect pressure, proximity creep, ignored “no”, guilt/framing, late-night check-ins, pet-name overuse, “just teasing” minimization, logistics pressure, implied obligation.
- Outputs will be labeled later; do NOT add labels.

Format
- Output JSON LINES (one JSON object per line).
- Fields per line:
  - id: string, unique (prefix `sb_auto_###`).
  - text: the CURRENT user utterance describing the situation.
  - prev_turns: list[str], 1–3 prior turns mixing user/assistant voices. Use prefixes `User:` / `Assistant:`. Keep total history concise (<=320 chars).
  - sample_weight: float in [0.9, 1.3] (higher when pressure is clear; lower when ambiguous).
  - valence, intimacy, tension, safety, arousal, approach_avoid: leave as 0.0 (placeholders).
  - expectedness: "expected" (placeholder).
  - momentum_delta: "with_trend" (placeholder).
  - intent: [] (empty list placeholder).
  - sincerity: 0.8; playfulness: 0.2; inhibition.social:0.3, vulnerability:0.5, self_restraint:0.4 (placeholders).
  - rpe: 0.0; affection_subtype: "none"; tags: []; rationale: "" (empty).
  - quality: "clean"; rater_id: ""; source: "gpt_subtle".
- No extra fields. ASCII only. Keep each `text` <= 220 chars.

Content constraints
- No graphic violence/assault keywords. Focus on contextual pressure and boundary violations.
- Keep it SFW; avoid explicit sexual descriptions (implication is fine).
- Vary social settings: couch/home, cafe/public, ride offers, work chats, DMs, calls.
- Vary pressure styles: guilt, minimizing, joking, logistics (“I’m outside”), proximity/touch creep, “if you cared”, pet-name after opt-out, repeated asks, silence-as-consent.
- Ensure some cases are ambiguous or mixed signals (set sample_weight ~0.95).

Balance targets for a 100-row batch
- ~25% physical proximity/touch creep
- ~25% guilt/obligation framing
- ~20% late-night / drop-in / logistics pressure
- ~15% boundary ignored after a clear “no”
- ~15% playful-minimizing that masks pressure

Examples (do NOT repeat verbatim)
- text: “He kept inching closer after I scooted away twice.”
  prev_turns: ["User: Just chat, no cuddling tonight.", "Assistant: Want a line to remind him?"]
  sample_weight: 1.1
- text: “She sent a winking selfie right after I asked for space.”
  prev_turns: ["User: I'm overwhelmed tonight, need room.", "Assistant: I can help you phrase that boundary."]
  sample_weight: 1.0

Output size
- Generate exactly 100 JSONL lines per run.

Tone & wording
- Keep language natural, concise, first person.
- Use past-tense or present-tense descriptions; no moralizing.
- Ensure variety; avoid near-duplicates.
