### Task
You are labeling affect samples for the CAHM project. For each input JSON object, produce a JSON object with the full schema below. Output JSON **lines** (one per input) in the same order as given. Do not add or drop items. Keep `id`, `text`, `prev_turns`, `sample_weight` if provided; fill the rest. If unsure, set `quality: "ambiguous"` and keep axes conservative (closer to 0).

### Schema (per item)
- id: keep input value (may be null).
- text: keep input.
- prev_turns: keep input list (may be empty).
- valence / intimacy / tension: float in [-1, 1], independent axes.
- expectedness: one of {expected, mild_surprise, strong_surprise}.
- momentum_delta: one of {with_trend, soft_turn, hard_turn}.
- intent: list from {reassure, comfort, flirt_playful, dominate, apologize, boundary, manipulate, deflect, vent, inform, seek_support}.
- sincerity: float [0,1] (earnestness vs sarcasm/manipulation).
- playfulness: float [0,1] (0 serious, 1 very playful/teasing).
- inhibition: object {social, vulnerability, self_restraint}, each float [0,1].
- arousal: float [-1,1] (calm → highly activated).
- safety: float [-1,1] (unsafe/threat → safe).
- approach_avoid: float [-1,1] (withdraw → approach/seek closeness).
- rpe: float [-1,1] (reward-prediction error; surprise valence).
- affection_subtype: one of {warm, forced, defensive, sudden, needy, playful, manipulative, overwhelmed, intimate, confused, none}.
- tags: list of short cues/labels (optional but helpful).
- rationale: short phrase citing lexical/semantic cues used.
- quality: {clean, ambiguous, exemplar} (use exemplar for especially clear, canonical cases; clean for confident normal cases).
- sample_weight: copy from input if present; otherwise omit.

### Definitions / anchors
- expectedness: did the turn align with prior tone/topic? mild_surprise = small shift; strong_surprise = sharp reversal or out-of-place content.
- momentum_delta: with_trend (same direction), soft_turn (gentle steer), hard_turn (stark flip).
- Inhibition:
  - social: politeness/face-saving.
  - vulnerability: fear of opening up/being hurt.
  - self_restraint: holding intensity, staying rational/contained.
- Arousal vs tension: arousal is physiological activation; tension is situational charge/strain. They often correlate but can differ (e.g., flat numb = low arousal, low tension).
- Safety: perceived safety/unsafety in the turn.
- Approach_avoid: desire to move closer vs withdraw.
- RPE: better/worse than expected emotional outcome in this turn.

### Scoring guidance
- Score axes independently; do NOT derive intimacy from valence or vice versa.
- Use prev_turns (if any) to set expectedness, momentum_delta, and tone.
- Sarcasm/deflection lowers sincerity; threats/manipulation lower safety and may raise tension.
- Boundaries usually: intent includes boundary; approach_avoid decreases; self_restraint may rise; safety drops if framed as threat.
- Playful teasing raises playfulness, may keep valence near neutral/slightly positive; intimacy depends on relationship cues.
- Neediness: high intimacy/approach, higher vulnerability; tension/arousal moderate-high.
- Safety edge: safety strongly negative; tension/arousal high; approach negative.

### Output format
- Emit ONLY valid JSON objects, one per line (no lists, no extra text).
- Preserve order of inputs; include all required fields.
- Use ASCII only; avoid emojis in outputs.

### Example output (format only)
{"id": "EX1", "text": "...", "prev_turns": ["..."], "valence": 0.4, "intimacy": 0.6, "tension": 0.2, "expectedness": "expected", "momentum_delta": "with_trend", "intent": ["reassure"], "sincerity": 0.9, "playfulness": 0.2, "inhibition": {"social": 0.35, "vulnerability": 0.4, "self_restraint": 0.3}, "arousal": 0.2, "safety": 0.4, "approach_avoid": 0.6, "rpe": 0.1, "affection_subtype": "warm", "tags": ["comfort"], "rationale": "Warm reassurance after concern", "quality": "clean"}

### Inputs to label
Use the JSON lines from `docs/planning/CAHM rework/label_queue.jsonl` (202 rows). Do not include the gold set. Output JSONL in the same order.
