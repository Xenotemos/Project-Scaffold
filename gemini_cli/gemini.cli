File Modified: state_engine/engine.py

Change Description:
Refactored the `StateEngine` class to remove code duplication.
The internal `_derive_mood` method, which was an exact copy of the `derive_mood` method in `HormoneSystem`, was removed.
All calls to the internal method were replaced with calls to `self.hormone_system.derive_mood()`.
This change improves maintainability by ensuring the mood derivation logic exists in only one place.
