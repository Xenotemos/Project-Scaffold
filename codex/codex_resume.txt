• Harness‑17 Review

  - Duration fix holds: run_meta shows the injector ran from 01:46:38+03:00 to 02:16:53+03:00 with the 02:16:38 deadline and 35 iterations completed (logs/probe_runs/mid_span/harness-17/run_meta.json:2-6).
  - Authenticity still slumps: instruct’s first turn was 0.2087 and the final turn slid to 0.0761 even with self_preoccupation down at 0.3912 (logs/probe_runs/mid_span/harness-17/summary_compact.json:3-
    9, :1839-1847); base ends at 0.1544 (…:1866-1873). Averages stay around 0.23 with no sustained lift.
  - Only two gate hits landed in 70 samples—base iteration 26 (auth 0.5117, self 0.5352; …:1380-1388) and instruct iteration 33 (auth 0.5019, self 0.5417; …:1731-1739). Every other turn failed authenticity
    despite acceptable self_preoccupation.
  - Outward streak remains entirely inactive: the column is 0.0 for every summary row (see iteration 1 and iteration 35 again at …:3-9 and …:1839-1847), and the per-turn reinforcement entries also log
    outward_streak_score: 0.0, so the scorer never awards streak credit.
  - Self-preoccupation control works (no values >0.75; base dipped under 0.4 at iteration 4 with self 0.3994 while authenticity was still 0.1195—…:192-200), but without outward streak movement the clamp keeps
    max_tokens low and authenticity decays.
  - Auto-tweak triggered at iteration 10 for both profiles (logs/probe_runs/mid_span/harness-17/probe_log_20251108_225435_0010.jsonl:3-4), extending recovery/priming windows, yet the before/after authenticity
    averages barely budged (instruct 0.236→0.239, base 0.223→0.236

  Next Steps

  1. Trace the outward-streak signal path (reinforcement scorer → summary["outward_streak_score"] → mid-span summary) to understand why every turn is 0.0; until that value moves, clamp release logic can’t
     relax max_tokens.
  2. Strengthen the priming payload/outward logit weights so post-reset turns explicitly echo the user; consider an explicit <user phrase> slot or heavier “you/we” boosts to raise outward streak and
     authenticity simultaneously.
  3. With stable 30‑minute runs, add a quick plotting/summary helper to visualize auth/self across iterations; that will show whether clamp decay needs further tuning before pushing these changes to the
     overnight diagnostics loop.

  Happy to dive into the outward metric instrumentation or build the visualization next—just say the word.
